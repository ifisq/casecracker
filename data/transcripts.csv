the coverage of the Disabilities     Act as well as an issue of its application  When an     organization arranges a golf tournament and invites the     public to compete for the opportunity to participate it     provides golfers with services privileges and advantages     of the golf course                Well thats rather like the     fact that a university that that offers to which the     public can apply doesnt then admit the whole public  It     has a selection process and so what only only the     admitted people can attend but the university is a public     accommodation                Yes  Thats a different point      All meant was that the fact that there is a selection     process does not deprive an entity of its status as a     public accommodation  If its open to the public to     compete to attend then that whole process is is     something thats open to which the public is invited               On the separate point what are the     circumstances                 You might be able to say that      There are two  the words would allow you to say that      There are two reasons why you wouldnt One is that     Congress made very clear that it was covering employees in     Title  and that it didnt intend to provide redundant     coverage in Title  so whatever one might say ab initio     that possibility is excluded                Well Id like to take to     answer that in two steps because take issue with the     proposition that these are employeelike independent     contractors  do say that even if they were they would     be covered but this is a much stronger case because in     fact there is no independent contracting relationship     here  The golfer does not does not undertake any     obligation to perform even in the way that an independent     contractor does  He is simply                 He doesnt make a commitment to      its my understanding of the record that he doesnt     make a commitment  It is true that if he doesnt appear     he wont be in the Tour anymore but he by qualifying and     being eligible to be in the Tour does not make a     commitment to participate                Its not quite the same thing    because there is no contract there is no contractual     commitment here at all                Thats correct  In fact     Tour explained in the district court when they were     attempting to defeat the claim that this was an employee     that it doesnt hire golfers that its a membership     organization a professional association that arranges     playing opportunities for its members and promotes their     interests  It compared itself to the in that regard      It provides opportunity for them  It provides services     for them                No you do not  In the  that     is the the particular sort of entity or status of     Respondent here is as said a much clearer case that he     is a consumer of the services or the privileges or                                     advantages of a public accommodation               Well the district court said so     in the context of deciding that he wasnt an employee as     if the only two options were that he was an employee or an     independent contractor  That is in deciding that he     couldnt take advantage of Title  for employees the     court said he is not an employee and looked to the body     of law that said people who arent employees are     independent contractors  But dont think that resolves     the question whether he maybe was something else entirely     a member or a potential member who was neither an employee     nor an independent contractor as that term is commonly     used in the working context He simply wasnt a worker     here at all               Petitioner argues that players cant be     consumers of services because they are providers of     entertainment to the spectators but that is simply a     false dichotomy  offers services to these two     different groups  It arranges playing opportunities for     golfers and viewing opportunities for the spectators  As     a result players both consume and provide services at the     same time just like the little league players who have                                     uniformly been treated by the lower courts as protected    users of a public accommodation                Well the difference is as     said think there is an argument that even those     independent contractors could be covered that the     Disability Act meant to open economic and social life to     people with disabilities and that                 Yes  think the simple answer     here is that the privilege of working for for money in an     employeelike role is simply quite different from what is     happening when somebody participates in a competition      The public accommodations laws as we said earlier     protect gamblers at a casino or exhibitors at a craft     fair or participants in a dance contest whether there     are money prizes or not whether the people who are     engaging in those competitions  mean think the      are doing it to make their living or are doing it as an                                     avocation  It wouldnt work to distinguish the    motivations of the different users of the services of that     accommodation  They wouldnt be protected if they were     employees               Its perfectly true that if golf arranged itself     differently and had employees here they wouldnt be     protected under Title                 The difference is that the     participation in a contest is a different sort of that is     open to the public is a different sort of thing from the     cut from the arrangement by contract by employment     contract or by some other contract to provide services               And Id like to point out of course that     covering people like independent contractors or like     contest participants which is what we have here under     Title  is not as has been suggested some sort of end run     around the limitations of Title                 Well youre making a comparison    to the theater you mean                Well in a theater of course     ordinarily there are employees so this issue they     ordinarily are employees so this issue doesnt come up      would suppose though that if if a if a performer sought     to rent a performance space he would be a consumer of     the of that facility and could claim that he was being     discriminated against as a consumer of that facility      Thats not usually the way performers relate to     performance space                Well think that the purpose     of the Disabilities Act was to was to be inclusive      think thats clear both from the statute and from the     legislative history so that would suggest that if     theres that doubts should be resolved here in favor of     coverage  But dont think its unclear  think that     that the that the public accommodations title was meant                                     to cover golf courses and participation in events at golf    courses so long as they are open to the public  And it     seems to me this is right in the heart of what the statute     was meant to reach               ,                                                                             Thank you Mr Chief Justice     and may it please the Court  This case

prizes or not whether the people who are     engaging in those competitions  mean think the      are doing it to make their living or are doing it as an                                     avocation  It wouldnt work to distinguish the    motivations of the different users of the services of that     accommodation  They wouldnt be protected if they were     employees               Its perfectly true that if golf arranged itself     differently and had employees here they wouldnt be     protected under Title                 The difference is that the     participation in a contest is a different sort of that is     open to the public is a different sort of thing from the     cut from the arrangement by contract by employment     contract or by some other contract to provide services               And Id like to point out of course that     covering people like independent contractors or like     contest participants which is what we have here under     Title  is not as has been suggested some sort of end run     around the limitations of Title                 Well youre making a comparison    to the theater you mean                Well in a theater of course     ordinarily there are employees so this issue they     ordinarily are employees so this issue doesnt come up      would suppose though that if if a if a performer sought     to rent a performance space he would be a consumer of     the of that facility and could claim that he was being     discriminated against as a consumer of that facility      Thats not usually the way performers relate to     performance space                Well think that the purpose     of the Disabilities Act was to was to be inclusive      think thats clear both from the statute and from the     legislative history so that would suggest that if     theres that doubts should be resolved here in favor of     coverage  But dont think its unclear  think that     that the that the public accommodations title was meant                                     to cover golf courses and participation in events at golf    courses so long as they are open to the public  And it     seems to me this is right in the heart of what the statute     was meant to reach               ,                                                                             Thank you Mr Chief Justice     and may it please the Court  This case presents an     important question of the coverage of the Disabilities     Act as well as an issue of its application  When an     organization arranges a golf tournament and invites the     public to compete for the opportunity to participate it     provides golfers with services privileges and advantages     of the golf course                Well thats rather like the     fact that a university that that offers to which the     public can apply doesnt then admit the whole public  It     has a selection process and so what only only the     admitted people can attend but the university is a public     accommodation                Yes  Thats a different point      All meant was that the fact that there is a selection     process does not deprive an entity of its status as a     public accommodation  If its open to the public to     compete to attend then that whole process is is     something thats open to which the public is invited               On the separate point what are the     circumstances                 You might be able to say that      There are two  the words would allow you to say that      There are two reasons why you wouldnt One is that     Congress made very clear that it was covering employees in     Title  and that it didnt intend to provide redundant     coverage in Title  so whatever one might say ab initio     that possibility is excluded                Well Id like to take to     answer that in two steps because take issue with the     proposition that these are employeelike independent     contractors  do say that even if they were they would     be covered but this is a much stronger case because in     fact there is no independent contracting relationship     here  The golfer does not does not undertake any     obligation to perform even in the way that an independent     contractor does  He is simply                 He doesnt make a commitment to      its my understanding of the record that he doesnt     make a commitment  It is true that if he doesnt appear     he wont be in the Tour anymore but he by qualifying and     being eligible to be in the Tour does not make a     commitment to participate                Its not quite the same thing    because there is no contract there is no contractual     commitment here at all                Thats correct  In fact     Tour explained in the district court when they were     attempting to defeat the claim that this was an employee     that it doesnt hire golfers that its a membership     organization a professional association that arranges     playing opportunities for its members and promotes their     interests  It compared itself to the in that regard      It provides opportunity for them  It provides services     for them                No you do not  In the  that     is the the particular sort of entity or status of     Respondent here is as said a much clearer case that he     is a consumer of the services or the privileges or                                     advantages of a public accommodation               Well the district court said so     in the context of deciding that he wasnt an employee as     if the only two options were that he was an employee or an     independent contractor  That is in deciding that he     couldnt take advantage of Title  for employees the     court said he is not an employee and looked to the body     of law that said people who arent employees are     independent contractors  But dont think that resolves     the question whether he maybe was something else entirely     a member or a potential member who was neither an employee     nor an independent contractor as that term is commonly     used in the working context He simply wasnt a worker     here at all               Petitioner argues that players cant be     consumers of services because they are providers of     entertainment to the spectators but that is simply a     false dichotomy  offers services to these two     different groups  It arranges playing opportunities for     golfers and viewing opportunities for the spectators  As     a result players both consume and provide services at the     same time just like the little league players who have                                     uniformly been treated by the lower courts as protected    users of a public accommodation                Well the difference is as     said think there is an argument that even those     independent contractors could be covered that the     Disability Act meant to open economic and social life to     people with disabilities and that                 Yes  think the simple answer     here is that the privilege of working for for money in an     employeelike role is simply quite different from what is     happening when somebody participates in a competition      The public accommodations laws as we said earlier     protect gamblers at a casino or exhibitors at a craft     fair or participants in a dance contest whether there     are money

It wouldnt work to distinguish the    motivations of the different users of the services of that     accommodation  They wouldnt be protected if they were     employees               Its perfectly

same thing    because there is no contract there is no contractual     commitment here at all                Thats correct  In fact     Tour explained in the district court when they were     attempting to defeat the claim that this was an employee     that it doesnt hire golfers that its a membership     organization a professional association that arranges     playing opportunities for its members and promotes their     interests  It compared itself to the in that regard      It provides opportunity for them  It provides services     for them                No you do not  In the  that     is the the particular sort of entity or status of     Respondent here is as said a much clearer case that he     is a consumer of the services or the privileges or                                     advantages of a public accommodation               Well the district court said so     in the context of deciding that he wasnt an employee as     if the only two options were that he was an employee or an     independent contractor  That is in deciding that he     couldnt take advantage of Title  for employees the     court said he is not an employee and looked to the body     of law that said people who arent employees are     independent contractors  But dont think that resolves     the question whether he maybe was something else entirely     a member or a potential member who was neither an employee     nor an independent contractor as that term is commonly     used in the working context He simply wasnt a worker     here at all               Petitioner argues that players cant be     consumers of services because they are providers of     entertainment to the spectators but that is simply a     false dichotomy  offers services to these two     different groups  It arranges playing opportunities for     golfers and viewing opportunities for the spectators  As     a result players both consume and provide services at the     same time just like the little league players who have                                     uniformly been treated by the lower courts as protected    users of a public accommodation                Well the difference is as     said think there is an argument that even those     independent contractors could be covered that the     Disability Act meant to open economic and social life to     people with disabilities and that                 Yes  think the simple answer     here is that the privilege of working for for money in an     employeelike role is simply quite different from what is     happening when somebody participates in a competition      The public accommodations laws as we said earlier     protect gamblers at a casino or exhibitors at a craft     fair or participants in a dance contest whether there     are money prizes or not whether the people who are     engaging in those competitions  mean think the      are doing it to make their living or are doing it as an                                     avocation  It wouldnt work to distinguish the    motivations of the different users of the services of that     accommodation  They wouldnt be protected if they were     employees               Its perfectly true that if golf arranged itself     differently and had employees here they wouldnt be     protected under Title                 The difference is that the     participation in a contest is a different sort of that is     open to the public is a different sort of thing from the     cut from the arrangement by contract by employment     contract or by some other contract to provide services               And Id like to point out of course that     covering people like independent contractors or like     contest participants which is what we have here under     Title  is not as has been suggested some sort of end run     around the limitations of Title                 Well youre making a comparison    to the theater you mean                Well in a theater of course     ordinarily there are employees so this issue they     ordinarily are employees so this issue doesnt come up      would suppose though that if if a if a performer sought     to rent a performance space he would be a consumer of     the of that facility and could claim that he was being     discriminated against as a consumer of that facility      Thats not usually the way performers relate to     performance space                Well think that the purpose     of the Disabilities Act was to was to be inclusive      think thats clear both from the statute and from the     legislative history so that would suggest that if     theres that doubts should be resolved here in favor of     coverage  But dont think its unclear  think that     that the that the public accommodations title was meant                                     to cover golf courses and participation in events at golf    courses so long as they are open to the public  And it     seems to me this is right in the heart of what the statute     was meant to reach                                                                                            Thank you Mr Chief Justice     and may it please the Court  This case presents an     important question of the coverage of the Disabilities     Act as well as an issue of its application  When an     organization arranges a golf tournament and invites the     public to compete for the opportunity to participate it     provides golfers with services privileges and advantages     of the golf course                Well thats rather like the     fact that a university that that offers to which the     public can apply doesnt then admit the whole public  It     has a selection process and so what only only the     admitted people can attend but the university is a public     accommodation                Yes  Thats a different point      All meant was that the fact that there is a selection     process does not deprive an entity of its status as a     public accommodation  If its open to the public to     compete to attend then that whole process is is     something thats open to which the public is invited               On the separate point what are the     circumstances                 You might be able to say that      There are two  the words would allow you to say that      There are two reasons why you wouldnt One is that     Congress made very clear that it was covering employees in     Title  and that it didnt intend to provide redundant     coverage in Title  so whatever one might say ab initio     that possibility is excluded                Well Id like to take to     answer that in two steps because take issue with the     proposition that these are employeelike independent     contractors  do say that even if they were they would     be covered but this is a much stronger case because in     fact there is no independent contracting relationship     here  The golfer does not does not undertake any     obligation to perform even in the way that an independent     contractor does  He is simply                 He doesnt make a commitment to      its my understanding of the record that he doesnt     make a commitment  It is true that if he doesnt appear     he wont be in the Tour anymore but he by qualifying and     being eligible to be in the Tour does not make a     commitment to participate                Its not quite the same thing    because there is no contract there is no contractual     commitment here at all                Thats correct  In fact     Tour explained in the district court when they were

its members and promotes their     interests  It compared itself to the in that regard      It provides opportunity for them  It provides services     for them                No you do not  In the  that     is the the particular sort of entity or status of     Respondent here is as said a much clearer case that he     is a consumer of the services or the privileges or
