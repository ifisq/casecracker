                                   Mr Chief Justice and may it please     the Court  The Ninth Circuit in our view made two     critical mistakes in applying the Disabilities Act to this     type of claim by a professional athlete First it failed     to recognize that Title  of the act the public     accommodations provision apply only to claims by persons     seeking to obtain inputs of a place of public     accommodation that is seeking to enjoy its goods or     services not to claims by persons seeking to supply     inputs as employees or independent contractors               Second the Ninth Circuit never took account of     just what a toplevel professional sport really is     nothing more or less than a competition that tests     excellence in performing what its rules require  Any     attempt to adjust the rules to compensate for an     individual players physical condition fundamentally     alters the nature of that competition               Now in turning to the first issue our position     is simply this  That Title  of the act would not apply                                      if Respondent were playing in tour events as an employee    of the Tour and the results should be no different just     because he is playing in the events                 Thats correct Justice OConnor      mean the argument                 Thats correct  The argument made by     Respondent is essentially that Title  covers any person     who is present at a place of public accommodation     whatever he or she is doing there whether they are a     customer an employee or an independent contractor      think thats wrong for several reasons               First of all just looking at the specific     language that you point to the notion of full and equal     enjoyment of goods and services it seems to me is quite     different from the notion of being allowed to provide the     goods and services                Well if may separate this into two     things because the  applies only to a very small     piece which is the qualifying tournament There is no     requirement playing on the Tour itself or on the Nike     Tour                But thats where one starts But in     terms of privilege Im using the term goods and services     not to skip over the others but simply as a shorthand     reference to all of that                Well except for it seems to me that                                      in fact the word privilege if it means the privilege to    work for a place of public accommodation to provide the     input of labor to a place of public accommodation then     naturally following that logic Title  would apply to     anybody an employee an independent contractor or anyone                Well think it does to be honest     with you Justice Souter  For example this happens to be     a game of golf  But if one thinks of the game of     football for example professional football is a game     that is played by employees  They are they are hired     think basically by the teams They compete against each     other                Well it depends on performance but     in a very specific sense of course the performance by any     professional athlete determines ultimately what he or she     gets paid  So if in fact one can say it is a privilege of     a place of public accommodation to be able to compete in a     professional sport then it seems to me that would apply     to any professional sport                Im not sure what difference that     makes Justice Souter because in a sense anybody can     compete to play on a professional football team  mean     professional football teams are drawn from the public at                                      large                 if they are good enough to     qualify                Well the  the thing that think     makes it more confusing it seems is that normally our     position would be that the opportunity to earn something     to start with without using the words win a prize from     it but the opportunity to earn something would not be the     kind of privilege or good or service that is being offered     by a place of public accommodation  Indeed people who     want to provide the inputs would be the kinds of people     who wanted to provide services and earn what they would     get in return  think what makes this case seem     different is because what Respondent in fact does for a                                      living is something that other people do for recreational    purposes or part of educational purposes               But again to take an example if the Tour     constructed its operation just slightly differently     instead of saying we will have everybody just compete for     the prizes as independent contractors if they said what     we will do is we will hire a group of approximately      professional golfers well make them employees well pay     them a modest salary just enough to kind of cover their     expenses as they play and then whatever they win over and     above that that will be their earnings               Now our argument would be that in that     arrangement the Tour would clearly not be subject to     suits by those golfers under Title                 They might be subject to suit                 Because Title  is the title of this     Act that deals with that kind of issue the question of     relationships between people who are providing labor and     the people who are paying for it                think it makes a                 think the difference between the     examples you are using Justice Breyer and this example     is those the people who go to the race tracks some of     whom may go to make a living are essentially doing the     same thing receiving the same outputs if you will from     the race track as the people who are there simply for     recreational purposes                But but think the difference     Justice Breyer is that at the time the tournament is     going on in fact there are no people there playing for                                     recreational purposes  During the time of the tournament    which is the time when the is operating the place of     public accommodation thats whats bringing the     within Title  with respect to the spectators for     example is because its operating a particular tournament     at a place of public accommodation  It seems to me                 Thats correct                Well Title  does not apply we     believe in the same circumstances as we dont think Title      of the applies to situations in which somebody is     simply seeking to provide seeking to obtain employment or     trying to obtain work as an independent contractor so     Title  of the Civil Rights Act would not apply in that     case                For both those situations  Now of    course the  the disabilities act itself and of course     the Civil Rights Acts that apply to race and sex and age     have provisions that deal specifically with the question     of who is working at different places and claims about     discrimination saying the terms and conditions that you     have set for a particular job are discriminating against     me                Under the disabilities act and not     under Title   Whether there are other provisions like     Section  for example in the case of race might     extend protection in that situation                The public accommodations provisions     in our view are intended again to deal with essentially     people who are consumers clients and customers                It is a modified version of the     second Justice Stevens  It is that they are not     individuals seeking full and equal enjoyment of goods     services privilege and accommodations as those terms are     properly interpreted                That the area generally  There is a     difficulty  mean one of the questions that one has is     is every piece of the property a place of public     accommodation or is the  are the ropes for example     dividing a place of public accommodation from a place that     isnt  That is one way to look at it               In our view the simpler way to look at it is     the second way that you have which is to say you have to     be asking in this question is the person an individual     receiving the kind of goods services and privileges that     are covered                But thats because thats because     they clearly are  The Tour doesnt deny Its putting on     an entertainment  It is putting on an entertainment to     which spectators are allowed so if one asks is the golf     course at this moment a place of exercise or recreation     as thats typically thought of under Title  our answer     would be think the better view is no  And the Ninth     Circuit actually interestingly didnt say that it was a     place of exercise or recreation and noted that we made the     argument it wasnt and basically said be that as it may     it is a place of entertainment and we  and what we are     saying is yes it is a place of entertainment and there     are people present at the tournaments who in fact are     enjoying goods and service and enjoying the entertainment     that we are providing                But the golfers are part of the     entertainment  Excuse me                Thats correct                Well Justice Kennedy Im not sure     agree with that  mean if if  the thing that makes     the Tour have the obligations to the spectators is the     fact that they are operating a place of public     accommodation during the tournaments You have to be     operating a place of public accommodation before you     become subject to Title                 But Justice Kennedy the Tour isnt     an abstraction  The Tour literally is are a series of     events put on by a c organization a nonstock     membership organization and they are put on for the     purposes of providing entertainment to the public  That     entertainment it seems to me is a product that they                                     offer at a place of public accommodation               Yes Justice OConnor  Let me talk     about that now if may  The  if one assumes for a     moment and for example the Seventh Circuit in the     Olinger case just assumed that Title  did apply to the     type of claim that the professional golfer there made  If     one assumes that then the question is whether the     modification thats requested here would fundamentally     alter the nature of Tour events and think that where     the Ninth Circuit went wrong on that particular question     is that it never really came to grips with what     professional athletics are               The professional athletics are as said in the     beginning simply tests of excellence  They are questions     of who can perform the best a particular set of physical     tasks and those tasks are defined by the rules of the     sport                Not  never in a highlevel Tour     event Your Honor  There has never been a situation in     the events we are talking about which is the events on     the highest level tours where they have allowed     different people                 Oh qualifying tours                 Well because the the principal     events that they put on are of course the events of the     Tour themselves the two highest level events  Qualifying     involves simply questions of logistics to be honest      There are there are many more people who are playing                Well first of all let me make                 Well let me make one point That                                     when carts are allowed they are allowed for all players    and that is essentially because there are choices that the     Tour has to make at any particular time about whether or     not there are enough caddies available whether there is     enough time on the golf course to get however many people     there are through the event in order to produce whatever     result they are looking for               With respect to the events we are talking about     the actual competitions on the Tour on the buycom     Tour which is the second level tour the Tour has always     required that all competitors observe all the same rules     including the walking rule There have been no exceptions     to that whatsoever                want to make clear two points      First of all that when talk about rules am talking     about what we have called in the case substantive rules      And that is rules that are intended to and do have the     potential to affect performance and the outcome of the     tournament  So first of all when Im using the term                                     rules am              Secondly though the question is if if you are     saying do we mean that for any rule or any accommodation     think the correct answer is yes although one sort of     instinctively would think that there should be some     process by which people can separate the performance     affecting rules that really count from the performance     affecting rules that dont really count  actually dont     think there is such a process                In a professional sport think     thats true that the purpose of a professional sport is     one thing and one thing only  Its to determine who is     the best at doing a certain set of defined tasks  If you     change what the tasks are if you change the rules that     people have to comply with so that you have different     rules for different players you are not going to get an     answer to the question of who is the best at that     particular thing                think our second argument is     slightly different Justice Scalia  agree with the     first part to start with  Yes  think if the Court     would agree on the first issue that the Tour could and     think the Tour could under the second simply by changing     what the rules of the sport are  Our position is not that     there is such a thing                 But then you                 think its  again our argument     just to make sure Im being clear is not that we are     contesting contending that there is a difference that     there are fundamental rules and nonfundamental rules  We     can tell which one is which and walking is a fundamental     rule  If there were such a way to tell we think walking     would be a fundamental rule  But our position in fact is     that all the substantive rules are fundamental rules                Rules are rules                You cannot because you absolutely                 You have to have the uniformity in     order to be able to measure what you do                Im sorry Justice Stevens                That what is fundamental                  yes  Except again want     want to be clear that what in fact is fundamental to any     particular game is the rules of the sport  That is what     defines what the sport is Therefore if there is not a     rule against it by definition its not something that     potentially affects the outcome of the sport as played     under its rules                Pardon me                think the difference in amateur     sports and the thing that makes makes the when you apply     the fundamental alteration language is that the     fundamental when you talk about fundamentally altering     the nature of a particular good or service that requires     looking at what the nature of the particular good or     service is  The nature of a professional sport is very     different think from the nature of most amateur     sports Probably not all                                                Not only that  mean amateur     sports do that to some extent as well but amateur sports     by definition and particularly high school college     grade school sports things like that have as part of     their very nature part of their very reason for being an     educational or recreational side  And therefore when one     comes to apply any fundamentally altered language to the     nature of that essentially amateur sports most amateur     sports have a dual nature  They have a nature that     involves sort of sorting winners from losers but they     also have a nature that says we are trying to get as many     kids in the high school or whatever to play  Professional     sports are not                 Well if its actually changing what                                     the good or service is                Well if it changes the nature then     though think one therefore one has to look at the     regulations for some guidance  And the regulations  Id     like to take just a minute before reserve my time if     may but the regulations are something that because the     United States hasnt cited them think maybe get lost a     little bit here  But under the regulations in Title      there is a specific provision that says a public     accommodation does not have to change its inventory to     accommodate disabled people  And the reason given for     that in the preamble of the regulations is that Title      requirements are intended to assure access to the goods     and services being provided not to alter the mix in     nature of the services typically provided               Now typically provided in this context we would     say are the tournaments with uniform rules including the     walking rule at the very highest level  That is one that     has been typically provided               And the reason think for that and think     this goes to your question Justice Breyer is that in a     sense any store or commercial entity is just whatever its     goods are a bookstore  An example is a bookstore does     not have to stock braille braille books  And there isnt                                     an inquiry every time as to how much trouble it would be    to stock braille books whether theres shelf space     whether they could get them or not  Theres a categorical     rule in the regulations that says thats not what were     talking about that would be a fundamental alteration and     thats exactly the same point we are making here               If may Id like to reserve the balance of my     time                                                    Thank you Mr Chief Justice Excuse     me  Just a few brief points               Responding in reverse order to the United     States argument first of all they say that the reason     that employers employees are not covered by Title  is     because that covers Title  but Title  doesnt cover all     employees  It only covers employees of a covered     employer  You have to have at least  employees to be     covered and if you are not an employee of a covered     employer you are not covered either  Yet the United     States position is that no employees are covered by Title      but really independent contractors or people similar to     that are in the same position essentially with respect to     Title  as noncovered employees under Title                Secondly the district court specifically said     that Respondent was an independent contractor not just in     talking about Title  but on page  of the joint                                     appendix it says the district court says focus only    on the issue of whether he is entitled to his requested     accommodation the use of a golf cart as an independent     contractor playing in defendants tournaments which are     held at places of public accommodation               Now  but should point out mean while he     is an independent contractor as defined by the district     court our point is not exactly it turns on whether he is     an employee or an independent contractor  Our point is he     is not a consumer of goods and services and there are a     number of people who are not consumers  Employees are in     the group Independent contractors are in the group      Partners in a law firm which is a type of public     accommodation are not in the group  Insurance agents are     not in the group  The issue is what they are not  They     are not people obtaining seeking to obtain or gain access     to goods and services  They are all in the category of     people who are providing goods and services to the public     accommodation so it in turn can provide its goods and     services to other people               Secondly just to make the contrast between the     people who are also playing golf and who are covered     Title  we concede it covers commercial opportunities     recreational opportunities educational opportunities      Those are all things specifically mentioned in Title  in                                     terms of defining whos a public accommodation  What  it    doesnt cover is professional opportunities the people     who are trying to get to make their living essentially     working for the place the operator the public     accommodation  So they are not like the tout at the race     track who is there in common with the other people     enjoying it for recreation  They are people actually     working like somebody who is behind the betting counter at     the race track who is working for the operator               Now just quickly on the points that Respondent     raises Rule  doesnt say golf is a sport of hitting     the ball from the tee to the putting hole  It says its a     game of hitting it from the tee to the putting hole in     accordance with the rules That is Rule                And the rules for this particular competition     include as there are permitted to be optional rules and     that in turn includes the requirement that competitors     walk the course  So if you if you are saying that you     cannot that you have to make waivers in that situation     for someone who cant comply then you are changing the     game               



                                   Mr Chief Justice and may it     please the Court  would like to take the liberty of     beginning with Petitioners second point because think     its something we have recently heard discussed here and     its think quite important               From  until  the ran a School to     determine                 Its a they call it the     School  Its a qualifying school Your Honor  And the     purpose of that School is to determine its a test of     excellence as Petitioner said to determine who is the     best and who can go on the Tour the following year  Its                                     a very intense course  There are  sessions  holes    played on courses just like the PGAs regular courses that     they play their tournaments on  The hard card which is     described in the briefs as the rules which impact tennis     tournaments golf tournaments under the the hard card     applies to those events but the walking provision of the     hard card is eliminated for purposes of the School and     what happens is there is a winnowing down process               In  when Casey tried out there was     something like  people golfers from the public who     wanted to play on the Tour  And they came in paid     their money had their references and started to play     and they winnow it down to  players by the third stage      Every one of those  players is going to either go on     the Tour the next year or on the Nike Tour at the     time and none of those players need ever have walked a     single hole not only in the qualifying but in their     lives                There are two leagues  One league     has it  One league doesnt                                                Well for the National League it     is fundamental  And it would not be permissible because     you would be changing                 Youre changing                 But Your Honor but Your Honor      cite cite what happens in the School to demonstrate     the fact that walking is not indeed fundamental because     they dont require it                It could                Rules could be changed                No he could not Your Honor      Because a fundamental                 Its fundamental                Its fundamental to the game                dont think its a silly rule      think it gauges how well the pitcher can control the     ball and get it within the strike zone Here we are     dealing with something that isnt fundamental  Not only     in the School  Any Monday a golfer with a two handicap     and two letters of reference can go out to a                                     tournament thats about to be run that week and they show    up and they present their handicap and their letters of     reference                Thats correct Your Honor                That case is in this Court That     case was decided on a different record from this record      That case dont think went into a very material aspect     of the proof in our case which was the nature of the     disability this tragic disability that he has and what     it did in terms of whether or not a a rule which would     require him to walk should be altered                Basically because if it doesnt     then you are not really gauging the second part which is                                     to consider whether or not an alteration is going to do    something fundamentally If its a superficial disability     giving a player an advantage may indeed result in an     alteration in that circumstance                Ingrown toenail Your Honor                agree with that but but the     Act the Act                 The Act does not accommodate that     kind of a disability  Casey Martins disability is indeed     accommodated                think its initially up to the     public accommodation in this case the to look at it     and decide                Yes it is  But Im talking about     in advance of it getting to the courthouse  If the     had done what respectfully suggest the law demands of     it which was to take a look at the nature of the     disability the individual disability of Casey Martin     rather than returning his medical records without looking     at them and returning the tape demonstrating the gravity     of his problem they would have seen the disability and in     those circumstances                 Respectfully Justice Ginsburg     dont believe there will be a lot of cases a lot of     people  Because just taking our  case the has     not had another lawsuit by a disabled person  The                                     which is here has had two lawsuits basically similar    facts  Now there has not been a huge wave of litigation     and the reason is a person like Casey Martin is very     unique  He never asked for any modification of any rule     affecting where he hits the ball how big the hole is or     anything else  He plays every single rule of the game      The only thing is his disability and the whole purpose of     the Act is to get people like Casey Martin a chance to get     to the game                As understand the rule Your     Honor basically in baseball the pitcher is not supposed     to move the ball in his hand prior to delivery                Regular pitchers take the ball as     you see they take it into their chest hold the ball     behind the glove and then make the delivery                Okay  think whats very     important is to understand what the game is what is the     competition  Now when you look at the rules of golf     promulgated by the Golf Association and St Andrews     this is the bible of golf  If you want to play golf     virtually in the world you play by these rules  What do     these rules say               Rule one of the game of golf hitting the ball     from the teeing ground into the hole by a stroke or     successive strokes  Thats the game  There is no rule in     the rules of golf                 would respectfully suggest the                                     system is to look at the nature of the rule               Initially it would be the public     accommodation  If they dont agree that there should be a     waiver of the rule then it has to go on up the line     including to courts if thats required                Yes  dont see anything quite     frankly respectfully extraordinary about that                Actually Justice Kennedy if you     wind up giving substantial deference in other words if     you roll over and let them make a rule and say its     substantive and thats the end of the game then you are     basically giving them a free pass out of the Americans     with Disabilities Act which would be improper                But its its not just a decision     by the sport  There is an implication and a very     significant implication in the statute which requires the     analysis  This is not something where Congress said     sports can have                 would  Im trying to live with     both theories if Your Honor please  But do believe                  that looking at at his     disability is very important  Because it enables the one     making the judgment to determine whether or not this     modification taking into account his circumstances is     really significant                dont know if Ive answered your     question Justice Stevens but think it largely turns     initially at least on the condition of the disabled     person and you look at that                No  Your Honor think if you     examine the way the has handled the whole walking                                     rule its replete with exceptions that you cant have    all of those exceptions and then argue its essential     because thats what the  you get to the definition                 But if youre testing the same     skills thats very important to my argument that what     are you testing  And when you look at the way they     handled the exceptions throughout this is the over s     just last week in Hawaii and this is not in the brief     but examples like this are in the brief  There are a     couple of holes out in Hawaii on the Mercedes championship     that were difficult for the players to negotiate because     they were hilly  They took them by cars                Everybody                Because walking is not the game      The game is hitting the ball and                 think it  you still have to     look at the rule to see whether that rule as imposed or     as modified giving an exception would fundamentally     alter that game                Im sorry                Your Honor what think is wrong     with it is that you would basically be giving the and     organized sports a free pass out from under the                 And we havent proposed the rule     as a sham but we have and rely upon the record which     reflects the trial judges conclusion after a sixday     trial that walking was not a significant matter                Under normal circumstances                                                can only suggest and there     was testimony with respect to the Open which was     held here in Washington in  testimony by the player     who won it Mr Venturi  And his testimony was that he     literally did get exhausted There was countertestimony     that said the exhaustion came from dehydration not from     walking and there was spectators at that event who were     passing out They werent doing any walking                think the abnormal     circumstance would probably be a circumstance that may     may have some relationship to performance but may not               



                                                                            Thank you Mr Chief Justice     and may it please the Court  This case presents an     important question of the coverage of the Disabilities     Act as well as an issue of its application  When an     organization arranges a golf tournament and invites the     public to compete for the opportunity to participate it     provides golfers with services privileges and advantages     of the golf course                Well thats rather like the     fact that a university that that offers to which the     public can apply doesnt then admit the whole public  It     has a selection process and so what only only the     admitted people can attend but the university is a public     accommodation                Yes  Thats a different point      All meant was that the fact that there is a selection     process does not deprive an entity of its status as a     public accommodation  If its open to the public to     compete to attend then that whole process is is     something thats open to which the public is invited               On the separate point what are the     circumstances                 You might be able to say that      There are two  the words would allow you to say that      There are two reasons why you wouldnt One is that     Congress made very clear that it was covering employees in     Title  and that it didnt intend to provide redundant     coverage in Title  so whatever one might say ab initio     that possibility is excluded                Well Id like to take to     answer that in two steps because take issue with the     proposition that these are employeelike independent     contractors  do say that even if they were they would     be covered but this is a much stronger case because in     fact there is no independent contracting relationship     here  The golfer does not does not undertake any     obligation to perform even in the way that an independent     contractor does  He is simply                 He doesnt make a commitment to      its my understanding of the record that he doesnt     make a commitment  It is true that if he doesnt appear     he wont be in the Tour anymore but he by qualifying and     being eligible to be in the Tour does not make a     commitment to participate                Its not quite the same thing    because there is no contract there is no contractual     commitment here at all                Thats correct  In fact     Tour explained in the district court when they were     attempting to defeat the claim that this was an employee     that it doesnt hire golfers that its a membership     organization a professional association that arranges     playing opportunities for its members and promotes their     interests  It compared itself to the in that regard      It provides opportunity for them  It provides services     for them                No you do not  In the  that     is the the particular sort of entity or status of     Respondent here is as said a much clearer case that he     is a consumer of the services or the privileges or                                     advantages of a public accommodation               Well the district court said so     in the context of deciding that he wasnt an employee as     if the only two options were that he was an employee or an     independent contractor  That is in deciding that he     couldnt take advantage of Title  for employees the     court said he is not an employee and looked to the body     of law that said people who arent employees are     independent contractors  But dont think that resolves     the question whether he maybe was something else entirely     a member or a potential member who was neither an employee     nor an independent contractor as that term is commonly     used in the working context He simply wasnt a worker     here at all               Petitioner argues that players cant be     consumers of services because they are providers of     entertainment to the spectators but that is simply a     false dichotomy  offers services to these two     different groups  It arranges playing opportunities for     golfers and viewing opportunities for the spectators  As     a result players both consume and provide services at the     same time just like the little league players who have                                     uniformly been treated by the lower courts as protected    users of a public accommodation                Well the difference is as     said think there is an argument that even those     independent contractors could be covered that the     Disability Act meant to open economic and social life to     people with disabilities and that                 Yes  think the simple answer     here is that the privilege of working for for money in an     employeelike role is simply quite different from what is     happening when somebody participates in a competition      The public accommodations laws as we said earlier     protect gamblers at a casino or exhibitors at a craft     fair or participants in a dance contest whether there     are money prizes or not whether the people who are     engaging in those competitions  mean think the      are doing it to make their living or are doing it as an                                     avocation  It wouldnt work to distinguish the    motivations of the different users of the services of that     accommodation  They wouldnt be protected if they were     employees               Its perfectly true that if golf arranged itself     differently and had employees here they wouldnt be     protected under Title                 The difference is that the     participation in a contest is a different sort of that is     open to the public is a different sort of thing from the     cut from the arrangement by contract by employment     contract or by some other contract to provide services               And Id like to point out of course that     covering people like independent contractors or like     contest participants which is what we have here under     Title  is not as has been suggested some sort of end run     around the limitations of Title                 Well youre making a comparison    to the theater you mean                Well in a theater of course     ordinarily there are employees so this issue they     ordinarily are employees so this issue doesnt come up      would suppose though that if if a if a performer sought     to rent a performance space he would be a consumer of     the of that facility and could claim that he was being     discriminated against as a consumer of that facility      Thats not usually the way performers relate to     performance space                Well think that the purpose     of the Disabilities Act was to was to be inclusive      think thats clear both from the statute and from the     legislative history so that would suggest that if     theres that doubts should be resolved here in favor of     coverage  But dont think its unclear  think that     that the that the public accommodations title was meant                                     to cover golf courses and participation in events at golf    courses so long as they are open to the public  And it     seems to me this is right in the heart of what the statute     was meant to reach
